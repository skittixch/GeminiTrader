**GeminiTrader: Authoritative Project Plan & Roadmap**

**Version:** 6.0 (2025-04-11)

**1. Core Philosophy & Strategy Foundation**

*   **Ultimate Vision:** To engineer and continuously refine a fully autonomous cryptocurrency trading and accumulation system, GeminiTrader. Its primary directive is substantial, multi-decade capital growth (the "rich by 100" objective), achieved through intelligent navigation of market dynamics, inherent volatility, and potential future systemic disruptions, all while operating with minimal human intervention.
*   **Hybrid Strategy Engine - The Triad of Operation:**
    1.  **Intelligent Accumulation (Automated DCA):** This forms the consistent capital injection mechanism. It utilizes a disciplined, automated Dollar-Cost Averaging strategy, decoupled from direct bank balance monitoring initially. Triggered by a pre-defined schedule reflecting income patterns (e.g., semi-monthly), it allocates a configurable base USD amount derived from estimated income. This baseline DCA reduces timing risk for core positions and ensures persistent market participation. Future phases enhance this with dynamic adjustments based on market conditions, confidence scores, and potentially fully automated bank funding integration (e.g., via Plaid).
    2.  **Volatility Harvesting (Adaptive Geometric Dip-Buying):** The core active trading component. Implements a layered strategy across multiple timeframes (e.g., 1h, 4h, 1d). It strategically places LIMIT BUY orders at geometrically spaced price intervals below the current market price, featuring geometrically increasing order sizes. This aims to systematically capture profits from price oscillations by concentrating capital allocation towards deeper, potentially higher-probability reversal points.
    3.  **Predictive & Contextual Intelligence Layer (Confidence & Targeting):** GeminiTrader transcends simple reactive trading by incorporating predictive elements informed by a vast data ecosystem. It integrates:
        *   **Technical Analysis:** Indicators (SMAs, EMAs, RSI, MACD, ATR), Support/Resistance zones (dynamic calculation), Trendlines (algorithmic identification, ML validation).
        *   **Market Microstructure:** Order Book dynamics (wall detection, depth analysis, imbalance, spoofing patterns, microprice calculation, liquidity vacuum identification, flow analysis).
        *   **External Context:** News Feeds (LLM-driven sentiment, topic classification, magnitude estimation), Crypto Asset Categorization & Narrative Tracking (e.g., L1 vs L2, DeFi vs AI, Privacy vs Meme, Quantum Resistance), Macroeconomic data and events (interest rates, inflation, geopolitical shifts, Fed announcements – primarily ingested via news analysis).
        *   **Social & Behavioral Signals:** Influencer tracking (sentiment, reliability scoring, auto-discovery), basic market psychology indicators (e.g., Fear & Greed index, volume anomaly detection, time-of-day patterns).
        *   **Long-Term Models & Cycles:** Bitcoin Power Law, Rainbow Charts, Halving Cycles, Stock-to-Flow, MVRV Z-Score, etc. (from sources like Bitbo.io).
        *   **Academic Research:** Periodic integration of validated quantitative finance concepts.
        All these inputs dynamically contribute to a composite **Confidence Score**, quantifying the system's conviction about the current market state and the viability/potential of specific trades or DCA actions. This score directly modulates:
        *   Geometric scaling factors for dip-buying (higher confidence may lead to more aggressive scaling).
        *   Dynamic Profit Target calculations (adjusting targets based on perceived risk/reward).
        *   DCA amount recommendations/actions (suggesting boosts or reductions).
*   **Anti-Fragile Risk Management (No Traditional Stop-Loss Philosophy):**
    *   Fundamentally rejects fixed price-based stop-losses, especially for designated long-term core holdings (e.g., BTC, ETH). Risk is managed through a holistic, adaptive framework:
        1.  **Granular Position Sizing:** Starting with very small ("tiny") initial bids minimizes the cost of incorrect entries. Controlled geometric scaling ensures capital is deployed more heavily only at significant price deviations.
        2.  **Capital Flow & Reserves:** Consistent DCA inflows provide cost averaging. Strategic allocation to stablecoins (a configurable reserve percentage) acts as both a risk buffer during downturns and a source of liquidity ("dry powder") for deep dip-buying opportunities.
        3.  **Dynamic Profit Taking:** Actively seeks to realize gains. TP targets are not fixed but adjusted based on the Confidence Score, market volatility (e.g., ATR multiples), proximity to resistance, and potentially time-based decay factors. This prevents holding potentially unfavorable *active* trades indefinitely, differing from the HODL approach for core assets.
        4.  **Confidence Modulation:** Automatically reduces trade sizing, scaling aggression, and potentially tightens TP targets during periods identified as low-confidence or high-risk.
        5.  **Time-Based Position Evaluation:** Includes logic to monitor the duration of open trades relative to their originating timeframe. Stagnating trades (not hitting TP or deeper buy levels within expected volatility cycles) may trigger a confidence reduction or target adjustment, prompting exit at reduced profit rather than holding indefinitely.
        6.  **Strict Filter Compliance:** Rigorous adherence to `minNotional`, `minQty`, `stepSize`, `tickSize` prevents order rejections and ensures capital isn't wasted on non-executable "dust" trades.
        7.  **Assumption Validation & Model Monitoring:** (Dedicated module) Continuously checks if the long-term models (Power Law, cycles, etc.) underpinning the macro strategy still hold true based on current price action. Detects deviations and potential invalidations.
        8.  **Catastrophic Event Framework:** (Later phase) Monitors for black swan events (systemic financial collapse, geopolitical crises, tech disruptions, environmental disasters) and implements pre-defined, drastic risk mitigation strategies (e.g., halt trading, shift majority to diversified stablecoins).
*   **Full Automation & Self-Sufficiency:** Designed for "set and forget" operation over extended periods. Aims for complete automation of trading decisions, order execution, state management, performance logging, and *critically*, the regular funding via the DCA pipeline. Includes self-monitoring and alerting for critical errors or required (rare) interventions. Intends to eventually cover its own operational costs (e.g., API fees, server costs) from trading profits if deployed off-premise.
*   **Data-Driven Evolution & Academic Grounding:** Incorporates mechanisms for continuous learning and improvement. Leverages rigorous backtesting, analysis of live trade logs, periodic retraining of ML models, and integration of insights from quantitative finance research and academic papers to refine strategies and maintain an edge. Includes a "Composer Agent" to ensure external dependencies remain optimal.
*   **Lean & Efficient Infrastructure:** Follows a local-first development principle. Employs intelligent, value-driven data polling strategies to balance information freshness with resource consumption (API calls, CPU, bandwidth). Architecture is designed for modularity and scalability, allowing migration from a local setup to more robust server/cloud infrastructure only when demonstrably necessary.

**Most Important Foundational Pillars (Implementation Order):**

1.  **Core Trading Engine (Geometric Dip-Buying + Basic Dynamic TP):** The active mechanism for deploying capital.
2.  **Robust Data Handling, Configuration & State Management:** The operational nervous system.
3.  **Exchange Filter Compliance:** The gatekeeper for successful execution.
4.  **Backtesting Framework:** The essential validation and strategy refinement tool.
5.  **DCA Logic & Semi-Automated Funding Pipeline:** The initial capital inflow mechanism.

---

**2. Development Workflow Strategy (Hybrid Approach)**

*   **Phase 0-2 (Foundation, Validation, Initial Funding): Jupyter Notebooks + Modular Python (`.py`) Files.**
    *   Notebooks are ideal for: Rapid prototyping of algorithms (DCA calc, grid logic, indicators), data visualization (price charts, indicator plots, backtest results), interactive exploration of API responses, initial backtesting runs, documenting research and findings.
    *   **Strict Practice - Code Modularity:** All core, reusable logic MUST be implemented in `.py` files within the `src/` directory structure (see diagram below). This includes API connectors, strategy calculations, database interactions, utility functions, indicator formulas, etc. Notebooks should `import` functionality from these modules. *This prevents monolithic notebooks and is crucial for transitioning to scripts/services.*
*   **Phase 3-5 (Live Trading, Intelligence Layering, Initial Scaling): Transition to Python Scripts.**
    *   The main operational logic (the 24/7 trading loop, state management, order monitoring, scheduled tasks like DCA checks or S/R recalculation) MUST be refactored into standalone Python scripts (e.g., `main_trader.py`, `dca_manager.py`, `state_monitor.py`). These scripts import modules from `src/`.
    *   Use a reliable process scheduler (`APScheduler` library within Python, or system tools like `cron`, `systemd`, Windows Task Scheduler) to manage the execution of these core scripts.
    *   Notebooks remain essential for: Monitoring the live system's performance (querying the database, visualizing logs), deeper analysis of trade outcomes, ad-hoc investigations, training and evaluating ML models (Phase 7+), and potentially triggering the semi-automated DCA steps (Phase 2).
*   **Phase 6+ (Advanced Features, Resilience, Deployment): Service-Oriented & Containerized.**
    *   As complexity increases (e.g., multi-exchange support, real-time news processing, complex ML inference), consider decomposing the application into more specialized, potentially independent services (microservices or logical service modules). This improves resilience and scalability.
    *   Package the application, its dependencies, and runtime environment using Docker (`Dockerfile`) and Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`). This ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
    *   Deploy the containerized application to a suitable 24/7 environment chosen based on reliability needs and cost-effectiveness (e.g., a reliable home server, a VPS provider, or a cloud platform).
    *   Implement robust external monitoring (e.g., health checks, resource usage dashboards using Prometheus/Grafana) and alerting systems (e.g., Telegram bot notifications, email alerts) for critical errors or required interventions.
    *   Notebooks continue to be the primary tool for high-level strategic analysis, research, visualization of production data, and ML experimentation.

**4. GeminiTrader Project Plan: Phased Modular Development (Detailed)**

*(Modules reference the structure above. Pseudocode examples provided for key logic.)*

**Phase 0: Setup & Foundational Tools (The Workbench)**
*Goal: Create the project scaffolding, establish basic API communication, implement essential precise math utilities, set up logging, and define the database structure.*

*   **0.1. Module: Project Setup & Environment**
    *   Action: Create the directory structure as shown in the diagram.
    *   Action: Initialize and activate Python virtual environment. Install base libraries (`python-binance`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`, `pyyaml`, `schedule`, `pandas_ta`, `tqdm`, `matplotlib`, `backtrader` or `vectorbt`, `mplfinance`, `python-telegram-bot`). Generate `requirements.txt`.
    *   Action: Create `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files and generated data/logs.
*   **0.2. Module: Configuration Management (`config/`)**
    *   Action: Create `config.yaml` defining: `API_BASE_URL`, `TARGET_TLD`, `QUOTE_ASSET`, `LOG_LEVEL_CONSOLE`, `LOG_LEVEL_FILE`, `LOG_FILE_PATH`, `DB_FILE_PATH`, initial `CORE_SYMBOLS` (e.g., `['BTCUSDT']`), `FEE_RATE`, base precision settings.
    *   Action: Create `config/settings.py` using a library like Pydantic or a simple class/dict to load `config.yaml` and `.env` variables, providing typed access (e.g., `settings.BINANCE_API_KEY`, `settings.BASE_DCA_USD`).
    *   Action: Create `.env` file for `BINANCE_API_KEY`, `BINANCE_API_SECRET` (and later Coinbase/Plaid/LLM keys).
*   **0.3. Module: API Connectivity (`src/connectors/binance_us.py`)**
    *   Action: `BinanceUSConnector` class implementation:
        *   Handles initialization with credentials from `settings`.

        *   `get_cached_symbol_filters(symbol)`: Implements fetching, parsing (`Decimal`), caching (`data/cache/exchange_info.json`), and retrieving specific symbol filters.
        *   Includes basic API methods needed for MVP: `get_account_balances` (returns `{ASSET: {'free': Dec, 'locked': Dec}}`), `get_latest_price` (returns `Decimal`), `get_order_status`, `cancel_order`, `place_limit_order` (takes formatted strings, returns raw response or raises custom exceptions like `InsufficientFundsError`, `FilterError`, `RateLimitError`).
*   **0.4. Module: Core Utilities (`src/utils/`)**
    *   Action: `formatting.py`: Implement and rigorously test `Decimal`-based filter helpers (`adjust_price_down`, `adjust_price_up`, `adjust_qty_down`, `format_decimal_for_api`). Handle edge cases.
    *   Action: `logging_setup.py`: Implement `setup_logging(config)` for file/stream handlers.
*   **0.5. Module: Database Setup (`src/db/`)**
    *   Action: `manager.py`: `DatabaseManager` class with methods for connection, execution (`execute_query`, `execute_update`, `execute_script`), table creation.
    *   Action: `schema.sql`: Define `CREATE TABLE` statements for `Trades`, `PortfolioHistory`, `DCAHistory`, `ConfigHistory`, `AssetInfo`, `Filters` (for caching). Use TEXT for storing `Decimal` values to maintain precision. Add appropriate indexes.
    *   Action: `manager.py`: Implement `log_trade(db_manager, **trade_data)` to interact with the `Trades` table (handles INSERT/UPDATE).
    *   Action: Initial script `scripts/db_manage.py --action create` to initialize the database using `DatabaseManager.create_tables()`.

**Phase 1: MVP - Core Trading Engine & Basic Backtesting (The First Run)** 📈⚙️
*Goal: Implement the core geometric dip-buying/fixed-TP logic and validate its mechanical function and basic profitability using the backtester.*

*   **1.1. Module: Market Data Fetching (`src/data/kline_fetcher.py`)**
    *   Action: Implement `fetch_and_prepare_klines` using `BinanceUSConnector`.
    *   Action: Create `scripts/fetch_historical_data.py` to populate `data/cache/` with `.pkl` files for required symbols/intervals.
*   **1.2. Module: MVP Strategy Logic (`src/strategies/geometric_grid.py`, `src/strategies/simple_tp.py`)**
    *   Action: `geometric_grid.py`: Implement `plan_buy_grid` function:
        *   Takes symbol, current price, *simulated* available USDT, grid config (`num_levels`, distances, amounts, scaling), and exchange filters.
        *   Calculates levels and target values.
        *   Performs feasibility checks (adjust price/qty, check `minQty`, `minNotional`, cumulative budget) for each level.
        *   Returns list of feasible order parameter dicts. Includes detailed logging.
    *   Action: `simple_tp.py`: Implement `calculate_fixed_tp_price(fill_price, tp_pct_config)` returning target sell price (`Decimal`).
*   **1.3. Module: Backtesting Engine (`src/backtester/engine.py`, `notebooks/01_MVP_Backtest.ipynb`)**
    *   Action: `engine.py`: Implement `Backtester` class:
        *   Handles simulated portfolio, open orders, trade logging.
        *   `run()` loop iterates through historical data:
            *   Checks fills against High/Low.
            *   Processes fills: updates balances, logs trade, plans TP (using 1.3), adds valid simulated SELL order.
            *   If not in position: plans BUY grid (using 1.2), places valid simulated BUY orders.
            *   Records portfolio history.
        *   Includes fee calculation and basic filter simulation (skip trade if `notional < minNotional` or `qty < minQty`).
        *   Provides results (metrics DataFrame, trade log DataFrame) and plotting capabilities.
    *   Action: `01_MVP_Backtest.ipynb`:
        *   Load data & filters. Configure backtester. Run simulation. Analyze P&L curve, trades, metrics vs HODL. Debug core strategy mechanics. *Crucial validation step.*

    *   Action: Enhance `log_trade` or add `log_backtest_trade` to store simulated trade details from the `Backtester` into the `Trades` table (distinguish `type` like `SIM_GRID_BUY`).

**Phase 2: DCA Logic & Semi-Automated Funding (Getting Capital In)** 💰➡️
*Goal: Define the DCA calculation based on schedule/income estimate and set up the initial semi-automated low-fee funding pipeline.*

*   **2.1. Module: DCA Calculation (`src/strategies/dca.py`)**
    *   Action: Add DCA parameters to config (`DCA_SCHEDULE_TYPE`, `DCA_SCHEDULE_DAYS`, `BASE_DCA_USD`).
    *   Action: Implement `calculate_dca_amount_v1(config)` based on schedule and fixed amount. Logs trigger. Returns amount.
*   **2.2. Module: Funding Pipeline Components (`src/connectors/coinbase.py`, `src/funding_pipeline.py`)**
    *   Action: `coinbase.py`: Implement `CoinbaseConnector` (requires `pip install coinbase`). Methods: `get_balance`, `get_price`, `place_advanced_limit_buy`, `withdraw_to_external`. *Handle API keys securely from config/env.*
    *   Action: `funding_pipeline.py`: Implement `FundingPipeline` class with state machine logic (`PENDING_USER_ACTION_BANK`, `PENDING_USER_ACTION_XLM_BUY`, `EXECUTING_XLM_TRANSFER`, etc.) and methods for each step (`initiate_funding`, `trigger_xlm_buy`, `trigger_xlm_transfer`, `monitor_binance_deposit`, `trigger_xlm_conversion`). Each method interacts with connectors and updates state/logs to DB (`DCAHistory` table).
*   **2.3. Module: Semi-Automated Pipeline Script (`scripts/run_dca_pipeline.py`)**
    *   Action: Create CLI script:
        *   `--step initiate --amount X`: Calls `FundingPipeline.initiate_funding(X)`, logs user instructions, sends notification.
        *   `--step confirm_xlm_buy`: Prompts user, if 'yes', calls `FundingPipeline.trigger_xlm_transfer(...)`.
        *   `--step check_deposit`: Calls `FundingPipeline.monitor_binance_deposit(...)`.
        *   `--step convert`: Calls `FundingPipeline.trigger_xlm_conversion(...)`.
    *   *User manually performs bank transfer and XLM buy, then runs script steps.*
*   **2.4. Module: Live Engine DCA Trigger (`main_trader.py` placeholder)**
    *   Action: Add scheduled check in `main_trader.py` draft: Call `calculate_dca_amount_v1`. If > 0, log notification: "Run `scripts/run_dca_pipeline.py --step initiate --amount X`".

**Phase 3: Intelligence Layer 1 (Live) - Dynamics, TA, Initial Confidence** 🤖📉▶️
*Goal: Add core TA, dynamic rule-based TP, S/R awareness, and basic confidence scoring to the live engine. Validate through paper/small live trading.*

*   **3.1. Module: Live Indicator Calculation (`src/analysis/indicators.py`, `main_trader.py`)**
    *   Action: Implement TA functions (ATR, SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD) in `indicators.py`.
    *   Action: `main_trader.py`: Periodically fetch recent klines, calculate indicators, store latest values in `StateManager`.
*   **3.2. Module: Live Dynamic Profit Targets (`src/strategies/dynamic_tp.py`, `main_trader.py`)**
    *   Action: Implement `calculate_atr_tp` using latest ATR from `StateManager`.
    *   Action: Integrate into `main_trader.py`'s `handle_buy_fill` logic.
*   **3.3. Module: Live S/R Detection (`src/analysis/support_resistance.py`, `main_trader.py`)**
    *   Action: Implement the *full* `calculate_dynamic_zones` function.
    *   Action: `main_trader.py`: Add scheduled task to recalculate zones for 1h, 4h, 1d using recent data slices and update `StateManager`.
*   **3.4. Module: Live S/R Integration**
    *   Action: Modify `plan_buy_grid` to use support zones from `StateManager` for placing orders.
    *   Action: Modify TP calculation (3.2) to consider resistance zones from `StateManager`.
*   **3.5. Module: Live Confidence Score V1 (`src/analysis/confidence.py`, `main_trader.py`)**
    *   Action: Implement `calculate_confidence_v1` using live data from `StateManager` (indicators, S/R proximity).
    *   Action: Integrate confidence score into live `plan_buy_grid` (adjust scaling) and TP calculation (adjust ATR multiplier).
*   **3.6. Module: Live Dynamic Trendline Adjustment** (As before - requires state tracking & cancel/replace logic in main loop)
*   **3.7. Module: Live Time-Based Trade Evaluation** (As before - track TP order age, potentially adjust future confidence heuristically)
*   **3.8. Module: Live Execution Script (`main_trader.py`) & Validation**
    *   Action: Flesh out `main_trader.py` with the full loop: fetch state, check DCA, check fills, handle fills (place TPs), plan grid (if applicable), place buys, log everything to DB, manage state, sleep. Include robust error handling.
    *   Action: Deploy script for paper trading or using very small real funds sourced via the semi-auto DCA (Phase 2).
    *   Action: Monitor performance via DB logs and compare to backtests. Debug and refine.

**Phase 4: Intelligence Layer 2 (Live) - External Context & Behavior** 📰🌍🎭
*Goal: Make the live engine aware of news, sentiment, asset categories, and basic market psychology.*

*   **4.1. Module: News Feed Aggregation (`src/data/news_fetcher.py`)** (As before - fetch and store in DB)
*   **4.2. Module: LLM Sentiment, Topic, Magnitude Analysis (`src/analysis/llm_analyzer.py`)**
    *   Action: Implement `LLMAnalyzer`.

**5. Key System Components (Conceptual Overview)**

*   **Data Ingestion Layer:** Handles fetching and caching data from all sources (Binance API, Coinbase API, Plaid API, News Feeds, On-Chain APIs, Market Psychology Indicators, Long-Term Models).
*   **Analysis Engine:** Processes raw data into actionable signals (TA Indicators, S/R Zones, Order Book Metrics, Sentiment/Topic Scores, Confidence Score, Long-Term Model Status, Behavioral Flags).
*   **Strategy Engine:** Calculates DCA amounts, plans geometric buy grids, determines dynamic profit targets based on analysis engine output and configuration.
*   **Execution Engine:** Interacts with the `BinanceUSConnector` to place/cancel/monitor orders based on Strategy Engine decisions, ensuring compliance with exchange filters. Manages the Funding Pipeline steps.
*   **State Manager:** Persistently tracks the live system state (portfolio balances, open bot orders, position status, DCA schedule/status, active analysis results) using the database. Handles recovery on restart.
*   **Database:** SQLite (initially) storing historical data, trade logs, analysis results, state information, configuration history.
*   **Backtesting Engine:** Simulates the entire system (DCA, strategy, execution, fees, filters) on historical data for validation and optimization.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Tracks system health, performance, API errors, and notifies the user of critical issues or required actions.
*   **Dashboard/UI:** Provides visualization of performance, current state, active strategies, and benchmark comparisons.

**7. Academic & Scientific Grounding Approach**

*   Maintain a `RESEARCH.md` file or wiki section linking specific strategy components (e.g., Geometric Kelly betting for scaling, RSI divergence signals, sentiment analysis impact studies, Power Law validation research) to relevant papers or reputable sources.
*   Use targeted LLM prompts periodically (e.g., `Find quant finance research on optimal DCA adjustments based on market volatility and MVRV score`) to discover new relevant studies.
*   Prioritize implementing techniques with some empirical or theoretical backing over purely speculative ideas (except for clearly marked experimental modules like LLM Personas).
*   Document the rationale for choosing specific indicators, models, or parameters based on this research.

**8. Conclusion**

GeminiTrader, as outlined in this comprehensive plan, represents a highly ambitious project aiming to fuse disciplined accumulation (DCA) with adaptive, data-driven trading (geometric grids, dynamic TPs, context awareness) and long-term resilience (model validation, catastrophe handling). The phased, modular approach, prioritizing backtesting before live funding and gradually layering intelligence, provides a structured path forward. Success hinges on meticulous implementation, particularly regarding precise financial calculations (`Decimal`), robust error handling, accurate filter compliance, reliable state management, and continuous validation against both historical data and live market conditions. While the journey is long, the potential outcome – a truly autonomous, self-sustaining, and significantly profitable system operating across decades – aligns with the project's foundational vision.
