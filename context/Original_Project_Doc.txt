GeminiTrader: Project Roadmap (Version 4 - Confidence & Dynamics) üöÄ
Core Strategy Principles:

Tiny initial bids: Exponentially increase bids dynamically adjusted by volatility.

Dynamic bids & sells: Adaptive orders with trailing ATR stops (for profit-taking) and momentum confirmations. React to price action near key support/resistance levels by adjusting bid frequency or sizing, avoiding traditional stop-losses.

Dynamic profit targets: ML-driven to maximize realistic targets, modulated by a dynamic 'Confidence Score'. Lower confidence may lead to adjusted (likely lower) targets to secure gains.

Confidence Score: Develop a composite score based on multiple data factors (technical, sentiment, on-chain, macro) to dynamically assess trade conviction.

Trend lines integration: Multi-timeframe, ML-validated algorithmic trend lines for order placement, with dynamic order price adjustments based on the trendline's current value.

Multi-Timescale Analysis: Integrate analysis across different timeframes. Larger timescale analysis informs strategic positioning, while smaller timescale analysis drives tactical adjustments. Includes time-based evaluation: if trades stagnate relative to their timeframe's expected volatility/momentum, confidence may decrease, influencing targets.

Rapid event-response trading: News-driven with multi-label classification, crypto category impact assessment, and market confirmation.

Macro-Economic Awareness: Incorporate analysis of broader economic cycles, interest rates, global events to modulate risk exposure.

Multi-crypto expansion: Adaptive diversification, volatility-scaled risk management, aware of crypto categories.

Robust Infrastructure: Transition from notebooks to modular, robust application architecture with comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and explicit state recovery mechanisms.

Trade & Strategy Database: Foundational database for logging trades, parameters, outcomes, enabling ML training and backtesting analysis.

Catastrophic Portfolio Stop: (Experimental/Needs Refinement) Implement a portfolio-level maximum drawdown rule triggered under clearly defined severe circumstances. Consider diversification into multiple stablecoins or adaptive measures like pausing scaling and advising manual DCA informed by context.

Phase-by-Phase Development Plan üõ†Ô∏è
Phase 1: Immediate MVP ‚Äì Geometric Dip-Buying üìà

(Notebook: 04-MVP-Geometric-DipBuy.ipynb, ~1‚Äì2 weeks)

Single crypto asset (BTC or ETH).

Geometric-scaled buy orders dynamically calibrated by ATR volatility. Calculate bid levels, scale quantities based on available USDT balance and exchange minimums. Strictly scoped to a single asset for MVP.

Simple ATR-based trailing stop (for profit-taking) with momentum confirmation.

Basic Binance connectivity, error handling, state persistence (file-based), logging.

Initial robust backtesting module to validate strategies (fees, basic slippage).

Trade & strategy database implementation: Store executed trades, associated strategies, parameters, and outcomes.

Phase 2: ML-Enhanced Dynamic Profit Targets & Validated Trend Lines ü§ñüìâ

(Notebook: 05-ML-Dynamic-Profit-Trendlines.ipynb, ~2‚Äì3 weeks)

Rigorous data collection: Volatility (ATR), RSI, EMAs, ROC, Volume, trend line interactions (touches, breaks, rejections), timestamps.

Multi-timeframe algorithmic trend line detection validated by ML.

Dynamic Trendline Order Adjustment: Implement logic for dynamic price updates on angled trendlines (evaluate update frequency).

Monitor S/R Levels: Track price action near detected trendlines/S&R. Develop logic to adjust bidding strategy (e.g., size, frequency) based on repeated tests or breakouts.

ML model (MLP regressor) for adaptive profit target predictions.

Initiate Confidence Score: Develop initial version using Phase 2 technical indicators (e.g., Volatility, RSI, MACD, Volume). Integrate score to modulate ML-predicted profit targets.

Time-Based Evaluation: Incorporate logic where ML model or rules adjust targets if trade performance deviates significantly from expectations over time (relative to timeframe).

Continuous ML retraining loop with explicit backtesting.

Expanded database integration for ML features and trendline data.

Phase 3: Advanced News-Driven Portfolio Reallocation üì∞‚ö°

(Notebook: 06-News-Event-Reallocation.ipynb, ~3‚Äì4 weeks)

RSS & advanced news feed integration with multi-label classification.

Enhanced LLM-driven qualitative magnitude estimation & Crypto Categorization/Impact Analysis. (Validate LLM outputs).

Enhance Confidence Score: Integrate sentiment analysis results and potentially external data feeds (Altcoin Season index, preliminary on-chain/flow metrics if APIs are viable) into the score.

Macro-Aware News Integration: Incorporate macro signals into strategic bias.

Rapid reallocation logic conditioned on market volume/price confirmation and category impacts.

Automated exits and risk management using time-based and volume-based alarms for news-driven temporary trades.

Database-driven logging/evaluation of news-driven outcomes.

Phase 4: Multi-Crypto Expansion & Advanced Risk Management üåêüîí

(Notebook: 07-MultiCoin-Expansion-Trendlines.ipynb, ~3‚Äì4 weeks)

Extend geometric bid scaling logic to a dynamically selected set of crypto assets.

Dynamic Coin Selection & Prioritization: System evaluates candidates based on available balance, minimums, return potential, volatility, trend strength, category relevance, and potentially Confidence Score.

Multi-coin selection adjusted by volatility, market cap, feasibility.

Explicit maximum capital allocation rules per asset.

Adaptive geometric scaling per coin volatility/trend lines.

Refine Confidence Score: Fine-tune weighting across all inputs, potentially make it asset/category specific. Fully integrate into multi-asset selection and risk modulation.

Infrastructure transition plan to modular service-based architecture (server/cloud).

Dynamic portfolio rebalancing informed by database insights, macro posture, category analysis.

Phase 5: Performance & Strategy Dashboard üìä

(Notebook: 08-Strategy-Dashboard.ipynb, ~2‚Äì3 weeks)

This phase provides long-term visibility into the system‚Äôs effectiveness, offering intuitive visual comparisons between GeminiTrader and traditional investment strategies.

Build a clear, minimal interface to visualize portfolio makeup and active strategies.

Display cumulative system performance vs. benchmarks (Buy & Hold, DCA, S&P 500).

Include a trading-view-like chart visualizing price action, indicators, orders, trendlines, potentially visualizing Confidence Score levels.

Enable filtering by coin, strategy, timeframe.

Emphasize insight over interactivity for understanding system efficacy.

Future Explorations / Phase 6+ Concepts üß†üåå

LLM Persona Modeling ("Madness of Man"): Explore using LLMs to simulate different market participant personas (retail, institutional, whale, influencer, other bots). Analyze simulated interactions to anticipate market psychology shifts and potentially refine strategy or identify new sources of edge. (Highly speculative, long-term research).

Advanced On-Chain & Flow Analytics: Deeper integration of paid/complex on-chain data (e.g., SOPR, exchange flows) and derivatives data (funding rates, OI) into the Confidence Score and strategy execution, if proven beneficial and APIs are sustainable.

Robust Infrastructure & Scalability üñ•Ô∏èüõ°Ô∏è

Explicit plan for transitioning from Jupyter notebooks to robust modular architecture.

Comprehensive error handling, monitoring, state persistence.

Detailed State Management & Recovery: Define and implement robust database-backed state recovery.

Data Feed Resilience: Health checks and fallback procedures for APIs.

Event-driven architecture considerations for scalability.

Avoiding LLM Safety Blocks üö´

Allowed: Qualitative market summaries, multi-label news categorization, sentiment analysis, crypto category impact assessment, macro context analysis. Maybe conceptual persona descriptions.

Avoid: Numeric predictions directly from LLM influencing trade execution without code-based model/market confirmation. Avoid asking for specific financial advice or parameters.
