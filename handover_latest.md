# GeminiTrader - Handover Document (2025-04-15 ~04:15 UTC)

**Project Goal:** Develop GeminiTrader, an autonomous cryptocurrency trading system aiming for long-term capital growth via a hybrid strategy (DCA, adaptive geometric dip-buying, confidence layer) and robust risk management, using the v6.5 development plan and the local SSoT management workflow.

**Session Focus & Current Status:**
*   **Focus:** This session primarily focused on debugging, refining the simulation framework, implementing state persistence, refactoring core logic, and improving the development workflow/output.
*   **Key Activities & Status:**
    *   **Simulation Data:** Created `scripts/download_sim_data.py`; identified `BTCUSD` data scarcity, switched to `BTCUSDT`; downloaded Q1 2024 data.
    *   **Simulation Integration:** Modified `main_trader.py` to load and step through CSV simulation data.
    *   **Debugging:** Resolved `TypeError` (pivot fetch), `AttributeError` (rolling pivots), `ValueError` (Series truthiness in indicator calc), `NameError` (OrderManager state update), `NameError` (StateManager typing import). Fixed simulation not terminating cleanly (`sys.exit`).
    *   **Refactoring (`OrderManager`):** Successfully created `src/core/order_manager.py` and moved order logic from `main_trader.py`.
    *   **State Persistence (`StateManager`):** Implemented `src/core/state_manager.py` (JSON save/load, type helpers, atomic saves). Integrated into `main_trader.py`. Confirmed persistence works across restarts.
    *   **S/R Zone Scoring:** Implemented basic scoring (`score_zones` v1) in `src/analysis/support_resistance.py` (touches, type, recency, composite).
    *   **Entry Conditions:** Refined `_plan_grid_buys` using configurable thresholds (confidence, RSI) and added trend filter (SMA cross). Removed balance hack warning.
    *   **Logging/Output:** Refined logging levels (more DEBUG), implemented `tqdm` progress bar with status postfix, added dedicated `errors.log` file, configured console level via `config.yaml`.
*   **Current Status:** The simulation runs successfully using CSV data, state persists, confidence score calculates, entry conditions are applied, S/R zones are scored (v1), order logic is handled by `OrderManager`, console output is clean via `tqdm`, and error logging is separate. The system is stable in simulation mode. Completed refactoring (Step 9), state management (Step 8), S/R scoring (Step 5), and entry condition refinement (Step 6).

**Key Files/Modules Implemented or Modified (Session):**
*   - src/main_trader.py (Major changes)
*   - src/core/order_manager.py (Created)
*   - src/core/state_manager.py (Created)
*   - src/analysis/support_resistance.py (Fixed pivot bug, Implemented score_zones v1, Fixed FutureWarning initialization)
*   - src/analysis/confidence.py (Fixed key issues, Adjusted logging)
*   - src/utils/logging_setup.py (Added error handler, console level param, color formatter, root level adjustment)
*   - config/config.yaml (Added state_manager, trading entry params, updated logging section, updated symbol/quote asset)
*   - requirements.txt (Added scikit-learn, tqdm)
*   - scripts/download_sim_data.py (Created)
*   - data/simulation/BTCUSDT_1h_2024-01-01_2024-03-31.csv (Created via script by user)

**Authoritative Roadmap Reference:**
The authoritative project plan is locally managed `SSOT.md` (based on v6.5). This session completed Steps 5, 6, 8, 9, and simulation framework refinements related to Steps 3 & 4.

**Key Learnings, Decisions & Conventions Established (Session):**
*   Confirmed refactoring `main_trader.py` improves clarity.
*   Established CSV-based simulation for deterministic testing.
*   Switched primary pair to `BTCUSDT`.
*   Adopted `tqdm` for cleaner simulation console output.
*   Implemented separate error logging.
*   Successfully debugged multiple integration issues (TypeError, AttributeError, ValueError, NameError).
*   Confirmed state persistence works for simulation resumption/completion recognition.
*   Confirmed log rotation (`trader.log.1`, etc.) is working as expected.
*   **User Directives Review & Meta-Instructions:**
    *   **Full Code:** The directive for providing full code blocks remains critical and was reinforced. I need to maintain 100% adherence. *Self-correction: Need to avoid providing only code snippets.*
    *   **Handover Content:** User prefers explicit next steps, references to specific files/functions, and inclusion of meta-instructions/learnings like these.
    *   **Clarity & Proactive Guidance:** User values clear explanations and proactive suggestions.
    *   **Git Commit Command:** **User explicitly requested that the handover document *always* include the version of the `context_manager.py` command that includes the `--commit` flag in the next steps section.**

**User Directives (Session):**
*   Consistently **required full code blocks** for all file modifications.
*   Requested help creating simulation data CSV.
*   Requested fixes for noisy console output and implementation of `tqdm`.
*   Asked clarifying questions about state persistence and simulation restart behavior.
*   Approved refactoring approach (`OrderManager`).
*   Approved implementing S/R scoring v1.
*   Approved implementing enhanced entry conditions.
*   Requested session end and handover generation with **specific inclusion of the commit command**.

**Actionable Next Steps:**

1.  **(User Action):** Save this **entire Markdown block** to the file `handover_latest.md` in the project root directory, overwriting the previous version.
2.  **(User Action):** Open your terminal in the project root, ensure your virtual environment is active, stage your changes (e.g., `git add .`), and then run the context manager script **using the commit option** to update the SSoT and commit changes simultaneously:
    ```bash
    python scripts/context_manager.py --update-ssot --handover-file handover_latest.md --commit
    ```
    *(Optional: If you prefer not to commit automatically, you can omit the `--commit` flag and commit manually afterwards.)*
3.  **(User Action - Next Session):** Copy the *entire content* of the generated `context_for_llm.md` file and paste it as the first message in our next session.
4.  **(Development - Next Session):** Proceed with **Step 7: Uncomment Read-Only API Calls**.
    *   **File:** `src/core/order_manager.py`
    *   **Action:** Uncomment the `self.connector.get_order_status(...)` calls within the `else:` block of the `check_orders` method.
    *   **Action:** Uncomment the `fetched_orders = self.connector.get_open_orders(symbol)` line within the `else:` block of the `reconcile_and_place_grid` method.
    *   **Goal:** Run `python src/main_trader.py` (with `SIMULATION_MODE = True`) and verify in the logs (`trader.log`, `errors.log`) that the bot successfully connects to the Binance.US API, makes these read-only calls, and handles the responses without crashing.
