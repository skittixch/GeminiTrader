# GeminiTrader - Handover Document (2025-04-14 ~21:25 UTC)

**Project Goal:** Develop GeminiTrader, an autonomous cryptocurrency trading system aiming for long-term capital growth via a hybrid strategy (DCA, adaptive geometric dip-buying, confidence layer) and robust risk management, using the v6.5 development plan and the local SSoT management workflow.

**Session Focus & Current Status:**
*   Focused on implementing **Actionable Next Step 2** from the previous handover (dated 2025-04-14 ~18:40 UTC): Enhancing the `scripts/context_manager.py` utility.
*   Successfully updated `context_manager.py` to support the new **local SSoT management workflow**.
*   Added command-line arguments (`--update-ssot`, `--handover-file`, `--ssot-file`, `--output-context-file`) and logic to:
    *   Read a user-saved handover markdown file.
    *   Append its content to the main `SSOT.md` file.
    *   Generate the full `context_for_llm.txt` file containing the entire updated `SSOT.md`.
    *   Optionally copy the full context to the clipboard.
    *   Generate a specific commit message (`chore(SSoT): ...`) when run in this mode.
*   Clarified the purpose and origin of the `handover_latest.md` file (user saves LLM output before running the script).
*   Tested the script's error handling for the case where the handover file doesn't exist.
*   **Current Status:** The `context_manager.py` script is updated and ready to process the handover file you are about to create using this text block.

**Key Files/Modules Implemented or Modified (Session):**
*   - scripts/context_manager.py

**Authoritative Roadmap Reference:**
The authoritative project plan is locally managed `SSOT.md` (based on v6.5). This session completed the utility enhancement step (Step 2 from the previous handover's "Actionable Next Steps") designed to support the local SSoT workflow itself.

**Key Learnings, Decisions & Conventions Established (Session):**
*   Solidified the new SSoT management workflow: LLM generates handover -> User saves to file (e.g., `handover_latest.md`) -> User runs `context_manager.py --update-ssot` -> Script appends to `SSOT.md` and generates `context_for_llm.txt`.
*   Implemented the `--update-ssot` workflow within `context_manager.py`.
*   Confirmed the script handles the missing handover file scenario correctly.

**User Directives (Session):**
*   Requested clarification on the `handover_latest.md` file.
*   Requested to proceed with generating this handover and testing the full script workflow.

**Actionable Next Steps:**
1.  **(User Action):** Save *this* Markdown block to a file named `handover_latest.md` in the project root directory.
2.  **(User Action):** Run the context manager script to process the handover file, update the SSoT, and generate the next context file. Recommended command: `python scripts/context_manager.py --update-ssot --handover-file handover_latest.md --commit` (add `--push` if desired).
3.  **(Development):** Proceed to the next development task outlined in the *previous* handover (2025-04-14 ~18:40 UTC), which was **Step 3: (Simulation Refinement)** Implement robust order reconciliation logic in `_reconcile_and_place_grid` within the `src/main_trader.py` file. (This involves fetching open orders - simulated first - and comparing intelligently against the bot's internal state).
