| Pillar                    | What it Means                            | Why it Matters / Source                                                                 |

| **Human-first purpose**   | Profits are a means to fund longevity tech & mobility cures for Eric‚Äôs daughter and others. The bot is a hope engine, not a casino.                                         | Original Conversation Context                                                           |
| **Antifragile wealth-building** | Tiny initial bids, geometric scaling, never hard stop-losses; risk is controlled by sizing, time-stops & confidence‚Äînot panic exits.                                     | Original Conversation Context                                                           |
| **Edge-Exploitation Agility** | Exploit our small-fish status: swing the entire book into/out of positions on breaking news, arb micro-opportunities, and deploy ‚Äúseed bets‚Äù in emerging markets (DeFi, Polymarket) where whales can‚Äôt enter undetected. | Small capital can enter/exit faster, skip slippage, and test niches that big funds ignore. |
| **Fee-Parsimony**         | Every basis point saved compounds. Prefer zero-fee venues, internal netting, on-exchange conversions, and batching to amortize gas / withdrawal costs. Track real-time fee drag in the dashboard. | High-turnover strategies die by a thousand cuts. Fee minimization is alpha.             |
| **Holistic intelligence** | Decisions blend technicals, long-term power-law models, news sentiment, on-chain/whale data and macro context.                                                            | Original Conversation Context                                                           |
| **Adversarial paranoia**  | Assume smarter, richer actors can move the market. Build a self-auditing ‚Äúassumption validator‚Äù that raises alarms on black-swans, model decay or policy shifts.           | Original Conversation Context                                                           |
| **Iterative autonomy**    | MVP must run 24 / 7 unattended; every new layer (LLM, ML, dashboards) plugs in behind feature flags so live profits are never blocked by R&D.                              | Original Conversation Context                                                           |
| **Complete transparency** | All code blocks are full-file replacements; logging is verbose but structured; every design trade-off is documented in handovers.                                          | Original Conversation Context                                                           |
